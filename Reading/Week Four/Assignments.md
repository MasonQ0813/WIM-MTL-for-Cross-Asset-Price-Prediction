## Assignment: 
(Optional, if you finish this part, please send to me by Teams or email)
* Change a Loss Function for Linear Regression Logistic Regression to re-generate the plots. (Check Documentation, you will only need to change a parameter value)
* Right now, we are doing Future <b>Price </b> prediction, change the code to predict the return and re-generate the plots.
## Reading Material Three (Mandatory)

We now have results from our models and a basic understanding of their application scenarios.  
However, we also observed that not every model performed well. This leads us to the next step: **model tuning**.  

In the first part of next weekâ€™s reading, we will focus on learning how to tune models to improve their performance.  
After that, we will explore the concept of **training** in machine learning.  
Specifically, we will dive into how a computer learns the underlying features of the data during the training process.
